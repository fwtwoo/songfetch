# songfetch
A simple Linux CLI tool, very similar to something like neo/fastfetch, that displays current song information in the terminal using playerctl and MPRIS/MPRIS2.

## Installation (Arch Linux):
You need to first manually install the package for ascii image conversion. You can install it from the AUR:
```bash
yay -S python-ascii_magic
```
or with pip/pipx:
```bash
pip install ascii-magic
or,
pipx install ascii-magic
```
Then install the full program:
```bash
yay -S songfetch
```

## Dependencies:
```bash
python
python-pillow
python-ascii_magic (AUR) (or ascii-magic from pip/pipx)
playerctl
```

## Player Compatibility

### Works Out of the Box

Most players **should** work without any additional setup:
- Spotify, VLC, Firefox, Chrome
- Rhythmbox, Clementine, Strawberry
- Any player that supports MPRIS2

### Requires Additional Setup

Some terminal/daemon-based players need an MPRIS bridge installed:

| Player | Package to Install | Command |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **MPD** | `mpdris2` | `yay -S mpdris2` (Arch)<br>`sudo dnf install mpdris2` (Fedora)<br>`sudo apt install mpdris2` (Debian/Ubuntu)|
| **cmus** | `cmus` | Check your distro's package manager |
| **moc** | `moc-mpris` | Check your distro's package manager |

After installing the bridge, enable it:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now mpDris2  # for MPD
# enable similar services for other players
```

To start the `playerctld` daemon and set it to run on startup, run:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now playerctld
```

If you get an error like `Unit playerctld.service does not exist`, or issues with player instances not updating correctly, create a user systemd service:

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/playerctld.service`:
```
[Unit]
Description=playerctld daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/playerctld daemon

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Reload user systemd and enable with:
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now playerctld
```

If you see `playerctld DBus service is already running`, it means another instance is active. Kill it with:
```bash
pkill playerctld
```
Then restart the systemd service as above.

## Notes
Album art colors will be displayed using ANSI terminal colors and will be affected by custom terminal color schemes (pywal, themes etc.), just like the other big fetching tools.

This program is designed to be used on **actual songs**, so running this while watching a YouTube video for example, might give unwanted results. This is due to the *non- 1 to 1 aspect ratio* of the "album art" (in this case, a YouTube thumbnail.
